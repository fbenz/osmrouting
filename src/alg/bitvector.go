/*
 * Package BitVector
 *
 * Here's a problem for you: The germany.osm.pbf file contains 101628726 nodes.
 * That's more than 2^26 (actually ~3 * 2^25) nodes.
 * The usual way to implement a set in go is as:
 *   map[int64] bool
 * and for a small number of items, say less than 2^23 this is very much acceptable.
 * Beyond that you run into trouble on a certain memory starved machine. Specifically,
 * my machine chokes (2GB of RAM total) for n somewhere between 2^24 and 2^25 elements.
 *
 * This is problematic, since the parser needs to find all node intersections
 * and that means keeping at least one bit per node. Well, this file is the
 * compromise to make this possible, with an acceptable performance hit.
 *
 * We implement van Emde Boas trees for 64 bit integers, shifting to flat
 * bitvectors for 16 bits or fewer. In my tests, the size of the resuling
 * sets quickly reaches about 300 MB if you use random 32 bit ints - that's
 * obvious since we just have to hit every second 16 kB block once to get to this
 * level. Beyond that it stays pretty much constant and will never be larger
 * than about 600MB - which is quite acceptable, since a plain bit vector
 * would require 512MB for the whole set of 32 bit integers.
 * The whole set of 64 bit integers will not fit into memory, no matter which
 * future you come from, so I wouldn't worry too much.
 *
 * In principle space consumption is linear, but as mentioned the overhead is
 * ridiculous for small sets. This is mostly since our block size is 16 bits,
 * rather than the more common 8 bits. (16 bits correspond to 8 kB of storage,
 * 8 bits are just 32 words)
 *
 * This is *necessary* the reason is that the meta data overhead of a map in
 * go is very high. I think in my measurements it was about 50 bytes per element.
 * If you set the block size to 8 bits, the program will explode (or really, use
 * more than a GB of storage) relatively quickly. Although it will scale much
 * smoother with few elements. But then again, if you have less than 2^24 elements,
 * don't use this. It's not going to be faster, and it is going to need more
 * memory unless all of your values are pretty much contiguous.

/*
 * Notes on Van-Emde Boas trees:
 * - We use a hash table to store the pointers to the next level and only
 *   create objects for non-empty subtrees. This means that the space consumption
 *   is linear. The overhead is still large for small sets though, but that's
 *   not really surprising.
 * - For k = 8, store a bitvector explicitly. This is because at this level
 *   we need 2^8 / 8 = 32 bytes to store the bitvector. Assuming 32-bit pointers,
 *   we would store 16 * 4 = 64 bytes for the additional indirection. This just
 *   just isn't going to help and will hurt space consumption for even a relatively
 *   modest load factor.
 * - Go does not have union types. We use interfaces instead, which results in an
 *   additional pointer for every reference. Since a veb tree stores only order
 *   sqrt(n) indirections this should be bearable.
